    Task 1
    In this task, you need to define six variables that holds the two products' names, quantities and costs.
    The values of these variables should be acquired via user input and type conversions.
    You can assume the input is always valid, i.e. type conversions should not raise an error.

    The variables should be as follows:
    `product1_name` (string): The name of the first product.
    `product1_cost`  (float): The individual cost of the first product.
    `product1_qty` (integer): The initial quantity of the first product.
    `product2_name` (string): The name of the second product.
    `product2_cost`  (float): The individual cost of the second product.
    `product2_qty` (integer): The initial quantity of the second product.

    The six created variables are then returned (returning variables will be taught in future lectures).

    Task 2
    In this task, you are given two variables: `qty` and `cost`.
    The variable `qty` holds a reference to an integer with the value of the quantity ordered.
    THe variable `cost` holds a reference to a float with the value of the cost of the product.

    Define a variable named `item_cost` so that it contains the total cost of that particular product.

    Task 3
    Similar to task 2, you are asked to calculate the total cost of products.
    However, instead of one product, you are asked to calculate the total cost of both products.

    Task 4
    In this task, you are required to output some basic calculated values using the `print()` function.

    What the variables represent should be identical to task 1.

    For example, if you have:
    Name: Apple,  Quantity: 2, Cost: $5
    Name: Banana, Quantity: 5, Cost: $8

    Then you should try to write code so that the output is:
    Number of Apple bought: 2
    Cost of Apple: $5
    Number of Banana bought: 5
    Cost of Banana: $8
    Total cost: $50
